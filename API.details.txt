Cable Headend
-------------
In the following examples we are using zip code 60030, headend IL57303.

Each headend file will contain metadata using JSON formatting.
Your JSON parser can obtain data at a number of "levels".

Top level:
"name" : The name of the headend. Usually this will contain city/state
information.
 "name" : "Comcast Lake Forest/Waukegan",


"location" : Physical location of the headend.
 "location" : "Lake Forest",

"Device Types" : An array containing information about the various analog
and digital services available in this headend. "Analog" will be the
channels you can receive without a set top box. "X" is the digital channel
lineup obtained with either a Cable Card or digital set top box. There may
be other options, depending on your location and provider.
 "DeviceTypes" : [
      "Analog",
      "X"
   ]

"metadata" : Additional information regarding the Device Types. Version and
Last Modified may be used by an application to determine whether the lineup
information it has stored is the most recent.
   "metadata" : [
      {
         "version" : "2",
         "device" : "Analog",
         "modified" : "2012-07-16"
      },
      {
         "version" : "6",
         "device" : "X",
         "modified" : "2012-09-05"
      }
   ],

"StationID" : an Array containing information regarding all of the stations
in this lineup.

The information for a station looks like this:
{
         "qam_virtualchannel" : null,
         "qam_modulation" : "QAM256",
         "callsign" : "WBBMDT",
         "qam_program" : "1",
         "name" : "WBBMDT (WBBM-DT)",
         "broadcaster-state" : "IL",
         "affiliate" : "CBS Affiliate",
         "qam_frequency" : "733750000",
         "stationid" : "20454",
         "url" :
         "http://ec2-50-17-151-67.compute-1.amazonaws.com/proc.php?command=get&p1=schedule&p2=20454",
         "broadcaster-city" : "Chicago",
         "broadcaster-zipcode" : "60611",
         "broadcaster-country" : "United States"
}

If QAM information is available, it will be included.
qam_virtualchannel - some providers will include information in the PSIP, so
a "friendly" designation may be "2.1".
qam_frequency and qam_program - used by an application to tune content. The
qam_program allows you to select between multiple programs on a frequency.

stationid is the XMLID - it is used as the "index" field throughout the
downloaded information.

affiliate may be used by applications to provide additional information
regarding content.

The various broadcaster fields specify where the content is produced;
certain "SuperStations" may be available globally, but the broadcaster
information will be for the source.

The URL field is the website which must be accessed in order to download
schedule data for this particular station.  All URLs for a particular
station ID will be the same.

NOTE: the URL field may be updated, so do not cache it.

"Analog", "X", etc. These arrays will provide a means to correlate a channel
number with a StationID.

For example:
 "X" : {
      "map" : [
         {
            "stationid" : "74348",
            "channel" : "001"
         },
        (etc)
         {
            "stationid" : "20454",
            "channel" : "189"
         }

Channel 189 on the set top box is stationid 20454, which from the stationid
array we know is WBBM-DT, the CBS affiliate in Chicago.

Lineup management is now the responsibility of the application. If a
provider has a custom lineup type, such as a digital terminal adapter, then
it is up to the application to allow the user to create a lineup called
"DTA" and specify which channels are in that lineup, possibly using the
information obtained from the "X" lineup and performing local re-mapping of
channel numbers.

An application should generate a unique list of which station IDs it
requires and download each one only once. The proof-of-concept
tv_grab_na_sd.pl grabber implements this by creating a hash of stations to
get, keyed on station id. Since each station id can only be in the hash
once, it ensures that you only pull station data a single time.

Antenna / Over-the-air
----------------------
The filename will be the postal code. 

The file format is similar to that of the Cable headend:

 "DeviceTypes" : [
      "Antenna"
   ],

   "metadata" : [
      {
         "version" : "2",
         "device" : "Antenna",
         "modified" : "2012-07-23"
      }
   ],

In this example, WBBM-DT is available over-the-air, it is on "2.1", and the
application needs to tune to VHF channel 3. Note that the stationid is the
same as in the Cable headend example above, so the grabber only needs to
download 20454 once, even if it exists in multiple lineups in the account.

   "StationID" : [
      {
         "callsign" : "WBBMDT",
         "name" : "WBBMDT (WBBM-DT)",
         "broadcaster-state" : "IL",
         "affiliate" : "CBS Affiliate",
         "atsc_minor" : "1",
         "atsc_major" : "2",
         "stationid" : "20454",
         "url" :
         "http://ec2-50-17-151-67.compute-1.amazonaws.com/proc.php?command=get&p1=schedule&p2=20454",
         "broadcaster-city" : "Chicago",
         "broadcaster-zipcode" : "60611",
         "broadcaster-country" : "United States",
         "uhf_vhf" : "3"
      }

Analog-only stations will specify atsc_major:0 and atsc_minor:0
      {
         "callsign" : "WOCHCA",
         "name" : "WOCHCA (WOCH-CA)",
         "broadcaster-state" : "IL",
         "affiliate" : "Low Power",
         "atsc_minor" : 0,
         "atsc_major" : 0,
         "stationid" : "33085",
         "url" :
         "http://ec2-50-17-151-67.compute-1.amazonaws.com/proc.php?command=get&p1=schedule&p2=33085",
         "broadcaster-city" : "Chicago",
         "broadcaster-zipcode" : "60625",
         "broadcaster-country" : "United States",
         "uhf_vhf" : "41"
      }


Free-to-air Satellite
---------------------
Follows the same format as the other example files, with fields that are
specific to satellite tuning. The file will contain information for C-Band
and Ku-Band satellites.

NOTE: the FTA lineup is not the same as Dish or DirecTV.

 "Satellite" : [

Schedule Detail File
--------------------
Each schedule file for a particular stationid will have 14 days of data.

A schedule file may be retrieved by executing the URL specified for the
stationid.

The server will send you a schedule file for station id with the filename
stationid_sched.txt.gz

This file is in JSON format and will contain information about the
programs for that stationid, and the times that the program is on.

For example, file 20361_sched.txt.gz contains:

{
"reduced_descr1":"In a world without electricity, an American family struggles to reunite.",
"reduced_descr3":"A family tries to reunite.",
"made_for_tv":false,
"reduced_descr2":"In a world without electricity, a family tries to reunite.",

"air_datetime":"2012-09-18T02:00:00Z",
"dvs":false,
"datatype":"schedule",
"3d":false,
"time_approximate":false
}

Each schedule file will have a single instance of a ProgramDetails object,
even if that particular program is shown multiple times in the 14 day time
period.

The air_datetime is ISO8601 in GMT, so the application must make the
appropriate conversion to localtime.

"duration" is seconds.

sex_rating, dialog_rating, fv_rating (fantasy violence), violence_rating and
lang_rating are booleans indicating that the content may not be appropriate
for all viewers.

"dvs" - descriptive video service.

"premiere_finale" will indicate Series/Season, Premiere/Finale combinations.

You will only be allowed to download schedule information for stationid's
that are in your configured lineups.

Command API
-----------
$URL is the URL for accessing the Schedules Direct web server. During beta,
$URL will be http://ec2-50-17-151-67.compute-1.amazonaws.com/proc.php

The script must first login to Schedules Direct by accessing

http://ec2-50-17-151-67.compute-1.amazonaws.com/rh.php

and submitting a form.

The server will return a file with the randhash embedded as a comment. The
script / application needs to parse the returned page for "randhash" and
include the &rand parameter for obtaining schedule listings.

--------

Parameters to proc.php:

- Obtaining status:
?command=get
	&p1=status

Retrieves account status and other notifications.

- Obtaining list of headends in a postal code
?command=get
	&p1=headend
	&p2={postalcode}

Example:
http://ec2-50-17-151-67.compute-1.amazonaws.com/proc.php?command=get&p1=headend&p2=60030

will retrieves a list of the over-the-air, cable and satellite lineup id's in postal code
60030.

- Retrieving a specific lineup 
?command=get
	&p1=lineup
	&p2={lineupid}

Example:
http://ec2-50-17-151-67.compute-1.amazonaws.com/proc.php?command=get&p1=lineup&p2=IL57303

will retrieve the list of channel numbers and station id's for lineup
IL57303.

also:

http://ec2-50-17-151-67.compute-1.amazonaws.com/proc.php?command=get&p1=lineup&p2=60030

will retrieve the over-the-air lineup for zip code "60030".

- Obtaining the schedule for a particular station id:
	&p1=schedule
	&p2={stationid}
	&rand={randomhashvalue}

http://ec2-50-17-151-67.compute-1.amazonaws.com/proc.php?command=get&p1=schedule&p2=20361&rand=cf2827d4a863b7167a468dc9e36a306a

?command=put - Sends commands to the server.
To send a suggested metadata update:

	&p1=metadata
	&p2=seriesid
	&prog_id={program_id}
	&current=123456
	&suggested=987665
	&source=thetvdb
	&rand={randomhashvalue}

http://ec2-50-17-151-67.compute-1.amazonaws.com/proc.php?command=put&p1=metadata&p2=seriesid&prog_id=
EP011054800102&current=79836&suggested=116811&source=thetvdb&rand=cf2827d4a863b7167a468dc9e36a306a

In this example, the series ID provided in the metadata was pointing at the
wrong series at thetvdb.com, so the season and episode information was
either blank or incorrect.

The user has submitted a suggestion that the current series ID of 79836
should be replaced by 116811. The metadata source is thetvdb and their
randhash is {randomhashvalue}. 

Metadata updates which do not include a randomhash will not be processed.

Other options:
current=0
	The prog_id doesn't have metadata, but it should. Indicate with
"current=0", and pass the suggested parameter.

suggested=0
	The prog_id has metadata, but it's wrong, and no alternate series
ID is suggested.

current={foo}, suggested={bar}
	The prog_id has metadata, but it's wrong and should be replaced with
something else.
